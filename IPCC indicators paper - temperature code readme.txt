There are separate items of Fortran code for each of the five global temperature data sets used
(note that China-MST is used for land only).

The code used for HadCRUTv5 (globaltemphadcrupub.f) is fully documented. The other four items of
code are similarly structured and vary only in data ingest and grid format/resolution. These are:

globaltempberkpub.f (Berkeley Earth)
globaltempnoaapub.f (NOAAGlobalTemp)
globaltempcmstpub.f (China-MST)
globaltempkadowpub.f (Kadow et al)
